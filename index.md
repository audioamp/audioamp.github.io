# Welcome to Audio Amp

Audio Amp is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) kit for teaching audio electronics in a lab setting.
It is designed to engage students at two levels of electronics experience:
1. *Beginner/introductory students*, who will learn how the system works at the block diagram level, and will be able to experiment with how different audio tones sound and look on the oscilloscope.
2. *Intermediate/advanced students*, who will learn how the transistor and opamp circuits work at the component level.

To make use of the Audio Amp, you will need additional equipment:
* 8Î© speaker with banana plug jacks
* oscilloscope
* waveform generator

Of course, you don't need to have a top-of-the-line oscilloscope and waveform generator to make use of Audio Amp.
Even a simple USB oscilloscope like the $30 [EspoTek Labrador](https://espotek.com/labrador/) would work!
And any smartphone with an audio jack can work as a make-shift function generator.

## Curriculum Goals
Beginner level:
* See and hear the difference between sine and square waves
* See and hear the effect of clipping distortion
* See and hear the effect of low pass and high pass filters
* See and hear the effect of guitar pedals

Intermediate level:
* Construct and calculate gain of a non-inverting opamp amplifier
* Understand how an opamp with negative feedback can correct for amplifier non-linearity
* Understand how to bias a single-supply opamp

Advanced level:
* Understand how a VBE multiplier (aka. "rubber diode") works
* Construct and bias a Class AB amplifier

## Future Work
* Make a stereo amplifier so students can experiment with phase differences between 2 channels, and utilize the XY mode on an oscilloscope.
* Make an interactive graphical simulator so students without access to any lab equipment can perform all the experiments.
